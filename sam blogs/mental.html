        The Children Act (2001,) which was revised in 2022 serves as the primary legislative framework protecting children’s rights in Kenya, explicitly prohibiting exploitative child labor and emphasizing the child’s right to a safe and supportive environment. It mandates protection from any work that could harm a child’s mental or physical health and requires the government to rehabilitate children found in hazardous work environments.

      <div>Psychological Trauma and Stress is among the heath issues children involved in labor often experience intense stress from long hours, harsh conditions, and sometimes abusive environments. This can lead to anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

        Working in exploitative environments with minimal social support can undermine a child's self-esteem, causing feelings of worthlessness and helplessness, which increase the risk of depression.

        Due to demanding work schedules and poor living conditions, child laborers often experience chronic fatigue and sleep deprivation, which have compounding effects on mental health and physical health.

        The government, with support from UNICEF and NGOs, has initiated awareness campaigns to educate communities about the dangers of child labor and its impact on mental health. These campaigns aim to shift cultural perceptions and reduce acceptance of child labor, creating a community environment that recognizes and protects children’s rights to education and safe, developmentally appropriate activities.
 </div>
 <div> Kenya’s government has made National Plan of Action Against Child Labor in collaboration with UNICEF and other agencies,whereby it has implemented action plans that focus on rescuing children from labor, rehabilitating them, and integrating them back into school or safe environments. These plans often include mental health support, counseling, and educational services to aid recovery from psychological trauma experienced during labor.</div>
