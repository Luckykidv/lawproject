        UNICEF approach on issue about child labour can be seen as it works with the Kenyan government to advocate for and strengthen child protection laws and policies. This includes supporting the enforcement of the Children Act, the Basic Education Act, and the Employment Act, which prohibit child labor and guarantee children’s right to education. By working with policy-makers, UNICEF aims to ensure that laws are both effective and implemented at all levels.
    </div> 
    <div>The Employment Act prohibits the employment of children under 13 and regulates the conditions under which adolescents between 13 and 17 can work. UNICEF collaborates with the Ministry of Labor to strengthen monitoring and enforcement mechanisms to prevent child labor. This includes supporting labor inspections, developing child labor monitoring systems, and training labor officers to identify and respond to cases of child exploitation. UNICEF also advocates for stricter penalties against employers who violate these laws.

        UNICEF’s approach to addressing child labor in Kenya is multi-faceted, focusing on both immediate protections and long-term preventive measures. Its efforts align with international frameworks, such as the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Labour Organization's conventions on child labor, to help Kenya meet its global obligations. Through these coordinated efforts, UNICEF works to create an environment where all children can enjoy their right to education, safety, and a life free from labor.
 </div>
 <div> The Children Act is a cornerstone of child protection in Kenya, explicitly prohibiting exploitative child labor. UNICEF works closely with government agencies to support the implementation and enforcement of this Act, which provides legal safeguards against child labor and requires the government to protect children from exploitation and harm. UNICEF also provides technical assistance and resources to help authorities at the local level interpret and enforce the Act, particularly in rural areas where enforcement can be challenging.</div>
