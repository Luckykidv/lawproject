                In Kenya, the Government has developed and adopted policies and enacted laws to protect children. However, thousands are still exposed to violence and abuse, harmful practices, lack of parental care and sexual exploitation. Children also face specific risks during and after emergencies such as floods, droughts, conflicts or epidemics. An emerging threat for children is online abuse and exploitation.

      <div>Around one in two young adults in Kenya experienced violence as a child, according to the 2019 Violence Against Children Survey, implemented by the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection. This found that 46 per cent of 18 to 24-year-old women faced at least one type of violence – physical, emotional or sexual – during their childhood, as well as 52 per cent of young men in the same age group. The prevalence of child marriage among girls stands at 23 per cent.

        The Kenyan Constitution has specific provisions that prioritize the rights of children. Article 53 guarantees every child the right to free and compulsory basic education, healthcare, shelter, nutrition, and protection from abuse, neglect, and harmful cultural practices. This ensures a broad spectrum of protections to support child welfare in different aspects of life.

 <div>The National Children Policy also provides a strategic framework for implementing child protection measures across sectors, including education, healthcare, and justice. It aims to address issues such as poverty, access to quality education, and health services, which directly impact children’s well-being. It also aims to strengthen family-based care and improve alternative care options for orphaned or abandoned children</div>
